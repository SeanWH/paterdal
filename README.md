# paterdal
A word game for people with poor vision.

This came out of two things: first, I needed something to use as the final project for a Python programming class I am taking, and second, because my dad (who has extreme vision problems) loves to play WORDLE but has difficulty even with his magnifier software.  He'd mentioned that it be nice if I could write a version for the visually challenged.

It's name comes from a portmanteau of Paternal and WORDLE--technically it probable should have been something like paterdle, but...
